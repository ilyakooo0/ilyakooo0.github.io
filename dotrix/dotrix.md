# Dotrix

Dotrix is an experimental vector drawing app rethought from the ground up for touch user interactions.

Traditionally vector drawing applications were designed to work with a pointing device and a keyboard. This approach doesnâ€™t translate well to the touch paradigm. While other editors have adapted the interaction model from personal computers, Dotrix was designed for touch from the very beginning.

Select points in your image and then choose how the points should be interpreted. Each layer is automatically combined into one shape regardless of how and in which order the path segments were added. Customize the properties of each layer separately.
